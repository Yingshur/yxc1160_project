1,"Basil I ""the Macedonian""",Βασίλειος Αʹ ὁ Μακεδών,"826-835?, Thrace",August 29 886,867-886,867,Macedonian,Hereditary Succession,"""Basil came of a peasant family that had settled in Macedonia, perhaps of Armenian origin. He was a handsome and physically powerful man who gained employment in influential official circles in Constantinople and was fortunate enough to attract the imperial eye of the reigning emperor, Michael III. After rapid promotion he became chief equerry, then chamberlain, and finally, in 866, coemperor with Michael. Quick to sense opposition, he forestalled the emperor’s uncle, the powerful Caesar Bardas, by murdering him (866) and followed this by killing his own patron, Michael, who had begun to show signs of withdrawing his favour (867).

From the mid-9th century onward, the Byzantines had taken the offensive in the agelong struggle between Christian and Muslim on the eastern borders of Asia Minor. Basil continued the attacks made during Michael III’s reign against the Arabs and their allies, the Paulicians, and had some success. Raids across the eastern frontier into the Euphrates region continued, though Basil did not manage to take the key city of Melitene. But the dangerous heretical Paulicians on the borders of the Armenian province in Asia Minor were crushed by 872, largely owing to the efforts of Basil’s son-in-law Christopher.

In Cilicia, in southeast Asia Minor, the advance against the emir of Tarsus succeeded under the gifted general Nicephorus Phocas the Elder. Though Constantinople had lost much of its former naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, it still had an effective fleet. Cyprus appears to have been regained for several years.

Basil’s plans for Italy involved him in negotiations with the Frankish emperor Louis II, the great-grandson of Charlemagne. The Byzantine position in southern Italy was strengthened with the help of the Lombard duchy of Benevento, and the campaigns of Nicephorus Phocas the Elder did much to consolidate this. The region was organized into the provinces of Calabria and Langobardia. But key cities in Sicily, such as Syracuse in 878, still continued to fall into Muslim hands, an indication of the strength of Arab forces in the Mediterranean.

Another arm of Byzantine policy was the attempt to establish some measure of control over the Slavs in the Balkans. Closely allied to this was the delicate question of ecclesiastical relations between Constantinople and Rome. During Basil I’s reign, the young Bulgar state accepted the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Constantinople (870). This had significant results both for the Balkan principalities and for the Orthodox Church, as well as greatly strengthening Byzantine influence in the south Slav world. Basil had inherited a quarrel between Photius and Ignatius as to which was to be patriarch of Constantinople. This had international implications, since appeals had been made to Rome. Immediately on his accession, Basil attempted to win support at home and to conciliate Rome by reinstating the deposed patriarch Ignatius and excommunicating Photius. Eventually, Photius was restored by Basil on the death of Ignatius (877) and recognized by Rome in 879. Contrary to the belief that used to be held, no “second schism” occurred. Basil successfully resolved the tension between liberal and strict Byzantine churchmen and managed to maintain a show of peace between East and West despite Rome’s displeasure at the marked extension of imperial influence in the new Balkan principalities.

Toward the end of his life, Basil seemed to suffer fits of derangement, and he was cruelly biased against his son Leo. Basil died on the hunting field. The 11th-century historian Psellus wrote of his dynasty as “more blessed by God than any other family known to me, though rooted in murder and bloodshed.” But Macedonian historians were understandably biased in favour of the existing dynasty, to the detriment of the rulers it had supplanted. Recent historical research has raised the stature of Basil’s predecessor, Michael III, and his regents. It is now generally agreed that the “new age” in Byzantine history began with Michael III in 842 and not with the Macedonian dynasty in 867. Basil’s policies were largely determined, both at home and abroad, by factors not of his own making.","Hussey, J.M. (n.d.). Basil I | Byzantine emperor. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica.

2,"Leo VI ""the Wise""",Λέων ΣΤʹ ὁ Σοφός,"866, Constantinople",11 May 912,886–912,886,Macedonian,Hereditary succession,"""Leo was the son of Basil I the Macedonian, who had begun the codification, and his second wife, Eudocia Ingerina. Made coemperor in 870, Leo succeeded to the throne on his father’s death. His foreign policy was directed mainly against the Arabs and the Bulgars. The able commander Nicephorus Phocas the Elder was recalled from his successful campaigns against the Lombards in south Italy to assist in the Balkans. After this Byzantium met with reverses in the West: Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902, Thessalonica was sacked by Leo of Tripoli, and the Aegean was open to constant attack from Arab pirates. Steps were taken to strengthen the Byzantine navy, which successfully attacked the Arab fleet in the Aegean in 908. But the naval expedition of 911–912 was defeated by Leo of Tripoli. Byzantium’s enemy to the north was Simeon, the Bulgar ruler. Hostilities arose out of a trade dispute in 894, and the Byzantines, aided by the Magyars of the Danube-Dnieper region, forced Simeon to agree to a truce. With the help of the nomadic Pechenegs, however, Simeon in 896 took revenge on the Byzantines, forcing them to pay an annual tribute to the Bulgars.

During Leo’s reign the Russian prince Oleg sailed to Constantinople and in 907 obtained a treaty regulating the position of Russian merchants in Byzantium, which was formally ratified in 911. Because of his anxiety for a male heir Leo married four times, thus incurring the censure of the church.

Educated by the patriarch Photius, Leo was more scholar than soldier. In addition to completing the canon of laws, he wrote several decrees (novels) on a wide range of ecclesiastical and secular problems. He also wrote a funeral panegyric on his father, liturgical poems, sermons and orations, secular poetry, and military treatises. Leo’s image is in a mosaic over the central door of Hagia Sophia.""",Encyclopaedia Britannica. (2025). Leo VI (Byzantine emperor). Encyclopaedia Britannica.

Sending Leo VI’s fourth wife, Zoe, to a nunnery, he replaced Leo’s advisers and reinstated the deposed patriarch, Nicholas Mysticus.

Alexander’s refusal to pay the annual tribute owed to the Bulgars by the treaty of 896 precipitated war with Symeon, their powerful and aggressive king. Alexander declared his nephew, Leo’s young son, later Constantine VII, his heir to the Byzantine throne and was co-regent with him for several months.""","The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica (1998).

He reduced the army and neglected the frontier defenses at a time when the Seljuq Turks were pressing into the eastern provinces; consequently, the sultan Alp Arslan overran Armenia (1064–65) and attacked Caesarea (1067). In 1064 the Hungarians occupied Belgrade, and the Pechenegs (Patzinaks) and Uzes (Kumans) crossed the Danube River and ravaged the Balkan provinces, penetrating into Greece.

5,Alexios I Komnenos,Ἀλέξιος Αʹ Κομνηνός,"c. 1057, Constantinople","15 August 1118, Constantinople",1081–1118,1081,Komnenos,Coup d'état,"""The third son of John Comnenus and a nephew of Isaac I (emperor 1057–59), Alexius came from a distinguished Byzantine landed family and was one of the military magnates who had long urged more effective defense measures, particularly against the Turks’ encroaching on Byzantine provinces in eastern and central Anatolia. From 1068 to 1081 he gave able military service during the short reigns of Romanus IV, Michael VII, and Nicephorus III. Then, with the support of his brother Isaac and his mother, the formidable Anna Dalassena, and with that of the powerful Ducas family, to which his wife, Irene, belonged, he seized the Byzantine throne from Nicephorus III.

Alexius was crowned on April 4, 1081. After more than 50 years of ineffective or short-lived rulers, Alexius, in the words of Anna Comnena, his daughter and biographer, found the empire 'at its last gasp,' but his military ability and diplomatic gifts enabled him to retrieve the situation. He drove back the south Italian Normans, headed by Robert Guiscard, who were invading western Greece (1081–82). This victory was achieved with Venetian naval help, bought at the cost of granting Venice extensive trading privileges in the Byzantine Empire. In 1091 he defeated the Pechenegs, Turkic nomads who had been continually surging over the Danube River into the Balkans. Alexius halted the further encroachment of the Seljuq Turks, who had already established the sultanate of Rūm (or Konya) in central Anatolia. He made agreements with Sulaymān ibn Qutalmïsh of Konya (1081) and subsequently with his son Qïlïch Arslan (1093), as well as with other Muslim rulers on Byzantium’s eastern border.

At home, Alexius’s policy of strengthening the central authority and building up professional military and naval forces resulted in increased Byzantine strength in western and southern Anatolia and eastern Mediterranean waters. But he was unable or unwilling to limit the considerable powers of the landed magnates who had threatened the unity of the empire in the past. Indeed, he strengthened their position by further concessions, and he had to reward services, military and otherwise, by granting fiscal rights over specified areas. This method, which was to be increasingly employed by his successors, inevitably weakened central revenues and imperial authority. He repressed heresy and maintained the traditional imperial role of protecting the Eastern Orthodox church, but he did not hesitate to seize ecclesiastical treasure when in financial need. He was subsequently called to account for this by the church.

To later generations Alexius appeared as the ruler who pulled the empire together at a crucial time, thus enabling it to survive until 1204, and in part until 1453, but modern scholars tend to regard him, together with his successors John II (reigned 1118–43) and Manuel I (reigned 1143–80), as having effected only stopgap measures. Judgments of Alexius must be tempered by allowing for the extent to which he was handicapped by the inherited internal weaknesses of the Byzantine state and, even more, by the series of crises precipitated by the western European Crusaders from 1097 onward. The Crusading movement, motivated partly by a desire to recapture the holy city of Jerusalem, partly by the hope of acquiring new territory, increasingly encroached on Byzantine preserves and frustrated Alexius’s foreign policy, which was primarily directed toward the reestablishment of imperial authority in Anatolia. His relations with Muslim powers were disrupted on occasion, and former valued Byzantine possessions, such as Antioch, passed into the hands of arrogant Western princelings, who even introduced Latin Christianity in place of Greek. Thus, it was during Alexius’s reign that the last phase of the clash between the Latin West and the Greek East was inaugurated. He did regain some control over western Anatolia; he also advanced into the southeast Taurus region, securing much of the fertile coastal plain around Adana and Tarsus, as well as penetrating farther south along the Syrian coast. But neither Alexius nor succeeding Comnenian emperors were able to establish permanent control over the Latin Crusader principalities. Nor was the Byzantine Empire immune from further Norman attacks on its western islands and provinces—as in 1107–08, when Alexius successfully repulsed Bohemond I of Antioch’s assault on Avlona in western Greece. Continual Latin (particularly Norman) attacks, constant thrusts from Muslim principalities, the rising power of Hungary and the Balkan principalities—all conspired to surround Byzantium with potentially hostile forces. Even Alexius’s diplomacy, whatever its apparent success, could not avert the continual erosion that ultimately led to the Ottoman conquest.""",The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica (n.d.).

6,Michael VIII Palaiologus,Μιχαὴλ ΗʹΠαλαιολόγος,"1224 or 1225, Empire of Nicaea","11 December 1282, Thrace",1259–1282,1259,Palaiologos,Coup d'état,"""A scion of several former imperial families (Ducas, Angelus, Comnenus), Michael passed a rather uneventful boyhood, seemingly marked primarily by fantasies of himself recovering Constantinople from the Latins; he spent much of his youth living in the imperial palaces at Nicaea and Nicomedia.""

""His remarkable resourcefulness and talent for intrigue were revealed early. At the age of 21 he was charged by the emperor John III Vatatzes of Nicaea with treasonous conduct against the state, a charge from which he extricated himself by the force of his wit. Later, on the death of the emperor Theodore II Lascaris in 1258, Michael was chosen regent for Theodore’s six-year-old son, John Lascaris. Gradually usurping more and more authority, Michael seized the throne and early in 1259 was crowned emperor after shunting aside and blinding the rightful heir, his charge, John. Faced with rebellion by Lascarid supporters in Asia Minor, Michael succeeded, in the eyes of many Greeks, in legitimating his rule by retaking Constantinople from the Latins. Whether as the result of Michael’s carefully planned ruse or of accident or both, the great city fell to his general in July 1261. Although the Greeks generally were exultant, a few realized that the centre of gravity had shifted from Asia Minor to Europe. In the long run this concern with Europe was to prove fateful, for it led to the neglect of the frontiers in the East and, with that neglect, eventually to the conquest and settlement of all of Asia Minor by the Turks.""

""From the first, Michael’s hold on the throne was precarious, surrounded as it was on all sides by Latins desirous of restoring Latin rule. Especially active was Baldwin II of Courtenay, the last Latin emperor of Constantinople. In his maneuvers to recover his throne from Michael, Baldwin finally entered into a diplomatic and matrimonial alliance with a man who was the West’s ablest diplomat—in his machinations almost the equal of Michael himself—Charles of Anjou, brother of St. Louis of France. At papal invitation, Charles advanced into southern Italy, expelled the last representatives of the imperial house of Hohenstaufen, Manfred and Conradin, and then from Palermo and Naples almost at once fixed his gaze across the Balkans onto Constantinople. To quote a chronicler, 'he aspired to the monarchy of the world, hoping thereby to recreate the great empire of Julius Caesar by joining East and West.'""

""In exchange for the papal promise to restrain Charles from attacking Constantinople, Michael promised to bring about religious union of the Greek church with Rome. That promise provoked the violent opposition of most of Michael’s own people, who opposed union on doctrinal grounds. Specifically, they objected to such parts of the Latin liturgy as the Filioque (statement of belief in the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son and the Father) and the use of the azyme (unleavened bread). Perhaps more important, most of them refused to accept papal ecclesiastical supremacy, which they felt, however obscurely, would lead to restoration of Latin political domination and possibly even cultural assimilation to the Latins.""

""Despite all the obstacles, union was nevertheless finally pronounced at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274. The Orthodox East was coerced into accepting union. Immediately after Michael’s death (1282), however, the Greek church declared the union invalid. The Greeks objected to the council on the grounds that not all the Eastern patriarchs or their representatives had been present, that no discussion of problems separating the two churches had taken place, and that no subsequent council had declared that of Lyon ecumenical. Nevertheless, for political reasons, Michael had struggled to maintain the union. But, when Charles of Anjou finally managed to enthrone his own candidate, Martin IV, as pope in 1281, Martin at once excommunicated Michael and at the same time pronounced Charles’s projected expedition against Byzantium a 'Holy Crusade' against the 'schismatic' Greeks. Included in the vast network of alliances erected by Charles to conquer the Greek East were not only Sicily, parts of Italy, Greek Lascarid dissidents, various Slavs of the Balkans, Baldwin, France, and Venice but also the papacy. Venice’s aim in particular was to recover the broad trading privileges it had exercised in the days of the Latin empire and to oust its arch foe, the Genoese, from the lucrative Greek markets.""

""The diplomatic duel between Charles and Michael was intensified, with Charles striving unceasingly to prepare his troops and navy. He even launched an attack across the Adriatic on Berat (in modern Albania) under the French general Sully but was repulsed by Michael. What Michael had on his side—the result of his consummate diplomatic ability—was (for a time) the papal alliance, a secret agreement with the Hohenstaufen supporters in Sicily, the support of Genoa, and, most important, a secret alliance with the son-in-law of Manfred, King Peter III of Aragon. The denouement to this remarkable contest was the outbreak on March 30/31, 1282, of the Sicilian Vespers, the massacre of the French signaling the revolt against Charles. Byzantium was saved from a second occupation by the Latins.""

""At his death, which occurred soon afterward, Michael thus left an intact empire to his son Andronicus II. But it cannot be denied that his policy of using ecclesiastical union to stave off Charles’s attack on his capital and the deep opposition that policy provoked among the Byzantine population established a fateful precedent for later Byzantine history. Moreover, by focusing his attention too exclusively on Europe, his policy helped lead to Ottoman occupation of all of Asia Minor and ultimately to the capture of Constantinople itself. Nevertheless, Michael’s positive accomplishments cannot be overlooked. He gave Byzantium two centuries more of life, began rebuilding the capital, and reestablished the University of Constantinople. His sponsorship of a general revival of learning led to the important Byzantine 'Renaissance' in the 14th and 15th centuries.""",The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica (n.d.).

Isaac tried to protect himself by concluding a treaty with Saladin, the sultan of Egypt, but he was soon forced to assist Frederick. Isaac concluded the Treaty of Adrianople with Frederick in February 1190, and in the following month Frederick’s forces were transported across the Hellespont to Asia Minor.

Free to turn his attention to the Balkans, Isaac restored Byzantine prestige by defeating Stefan Nemanja of Serbia (1190). With Hungarian help, he planned an expedition against the Bulgarians, assembling a Byzantine army for this purpose near the city of Cypsela in the spring of 1195. On April 8, however, he was suddenly overthrown by his brother, who imprisoned and blinded him and assumed the throne as Emperor Alexius III.

In 1201 Isaac’s son Alexius made his way to Germany, where he succeeded in bringing about the diversion of the Fourth Crusade to Constantinople in order to restore his father to power. In July 1203 the Crusaders entered the city, and on August 1 Isaac, after eight years’ imprisonment, was crowned co-emperor with Alexius, who assumed the title Alexius IV. Friction between the Crusaders and the townspeople of Constantinople, however, led to a revolution in January 1204.

Two years later he reconquered all of Cilicia from the kingdom of Lower Armenia and later forced Raymond of Poitiers, prince of Antioch, to recognize Byzantine suzerainty.

His lack of military initiative enabled the Ottoman Turks to gain control of nearly all of Anatolia by 1300, and his employment of Catalan mercenaries in 1304 ended disastrously, because the Catalans proved more inclined to pillage Byzantine cities than to fight the Turks. In the war between the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa, Andronicus unwisely took sides, favouring Genoa, and suffered the wrath of the greatly superior Venetian navy.

Internally, Andronicus’s reign was marked by a steady disintegration of centralized authority and increasing economic difficulties, although he did sponsor a revival of Byzantine art and culture and championed the independence of the Eastern Orthodox church. During his reign the great monastery complex at Mount Athos in Greece enjoyed its golden age.
