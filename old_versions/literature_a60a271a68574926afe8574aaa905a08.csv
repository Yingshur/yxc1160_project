1,Madrid Skylitzes,Σύνοψις Ἱστοριῶν,John Skylitzes,12ths century,"National Library of Spain, Madrid",Chronicle,"""The Madrid Skylitzes (Biblioteca Nacional, vitr.26-2) is a twelfth-century illustrated manuscript of John Skylitzes’ historical chronicle, the *Synopsis Historion*. It narrates the history of the Byzantine Empire from 811 to 1057, covering the reigns of emperors from Nikephoros I to Michael VI.

What makes the Madrid Skylitzes exceptional is that it is the only surviving illustrated manuscript of a Greek chronicle. Containing 574 vivid miniatures, it provides visual insights into nearly every aspect of Byzantine life—naval expeditions, sieges, court rituals, religious ceremonies, dreams, and even rare depictions such as conjoined twins. These images enrich and complicate the relationship between text and image, narrative and illustration.

Produced in Norman Sicily, the manuscript is a product of cultural confluence. Its Greek text, copied in a Latin and Arabic-speaking context, opens up questions about the manuscript’s intended audience, its function, and the transmission of Byzantine historical memory in the multicultural environment of twelfth-century Sicily.

The manuscript has become the centerpiece of an international scholarly effort. A multimedia edition is in development, combining critical commentary on text, imagery, captions, and narrative structure. Dr. Bente Bjornholt at the University of Sussex is constructing a detailed image database, categorizing iconographic features, styles, and colors for public access. Meanwhile, the textual commentary is being led by Associate Professor Roger Scott at the University of Melbourne, in collaboration with scholars from Melbourne and Manitoba, ensuring a comprehensive scholarly resource for future study.""",Sussex Centre for Byzantine Cultural History. 2025.
